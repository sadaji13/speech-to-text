Hello Terps, the University of Maryland has earned our reputation as one of the premier

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,680
universities in the world.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,840
We are approaching 70 members of the prestigious national academies among our faculty and have

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,920
nearly 50 members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,160
Our students earned more than 100 major national and international awards last year, including

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,720
54 students and scholars who accepted Fulbright grants.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,680
This week, U.S. News and World Report released its annual college rankings and the University

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,680
of Maryland ranked 19th among all U.S. public universities.

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,440
Additionally, we now have almost 70 schools, colleges, programs and specialties on the

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,640
U.S. News Top 25 lists.

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,480
Our excellence extends well beyond our nationally recognized academic programs.

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,680
Number 1 School for LGBTQ Plus Students

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,480
A top school for entrepreneurship, for veterans and for research.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,000
And we were also recognized as one of the best places to work by both Newsweek Magazine

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,040
and Forbes Magazine.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:22,200
Collectively, these rankings fill me with tremendous pride and I hope they make you proud of your

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,240
flagship university.

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,400
These rankings are important, but more importantly are what they represent.

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,880
Rankings are not merely numbers, they are a reflection of our commitments and our priorities,

20
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,600
including our focus on building academic and research excellence, fostering a welcoming

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,720
multicultural community, creating an innovative and entrepreneurial culture and investing

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,000
in people and communities.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,840
It is extremely gratifying to see these investments and priorities being reflected in national

24
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,000
and international rankings.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,280
When we pursue excellence in all we do, the University of Maryland continues our upward

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,760
trajectory.

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,280
And that's something we can all be proud of.

28
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,360
