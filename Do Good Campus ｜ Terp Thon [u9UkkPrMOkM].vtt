00:00.000 --> 00:09.720
Today we are so excited to welcome thousands of University of Maryland students as we all

00:09.720 --> 00:12.600
come together united under one cause.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.080
Turpan is the largest student-run philanthropy in the state of Maryland.

00:16.080 --> 00:21.160
We raise funds and awareness for Children's National Health System.

00:21.160 --> 00:25.400
We're here at the Army today where we all pledge to stand for 12 hours to honor the

00:25.400 --> 00:28.240
patients and families at Children's National Health System.

00:28.240 --> 00:32.240
We spend all year caring for these kids, caring for the hospital, and the most incredible

00:32.240 --> 00:36.680
thing is to see 3,000 students coming together and supporting the hospital, supporting the

00:36.680 --> 00:37.920
kids.

00:37.920 --> 00:42.920
It's not a feeling you can describe.

00:42.920 --> 00:46.520
Back in 2010, Brooke was about to turn two.

00:46.520 --> 00:51.360
Brooke was treated at Children's National Medical Center for Acute Myeloid Leukemia, and Caitlin

00:51.360 --> 00:55.720
actually was her donor, gave her bone marrow to cure her cancer, and so they asked us to

00:55.720 --> 00:58.800
get involved in fundraising, and they invited us to Turpan.

00:58.800 --> 01:02.480
The girls come here, they get treated like rock stars.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.480
To Turpan, I actually host events all year round to raise money for the kids at the hospital,

01:06.480 --> 01:10.680
and that's everything from hosting a festival of hope color on earlier this year, blood

01:10.680 --> 01:12.760
drives, the whole line yards.

01:12.760 --> 01:17.880
I am so proud and so inspired by Turpan.

01:17.880 --> 01:21.600
One of Turpan's biggest missions has always been to create this culture of philanthropy

01:21.600 --> 01:22.600
on campus.

01:22.800 --> 01:27.520
And now that the University of Maryland is the Do Good University, we are so excited

01:27.520 --> 01:30.520
to be surrounded by people on campus whose priority is philanthropy.
