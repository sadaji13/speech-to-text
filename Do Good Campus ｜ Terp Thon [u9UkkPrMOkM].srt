00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,720
Today we are so excited to welcome thousands of University of Maryland students as we all

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,600
come together united under one cause.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,080
Turpan is the largest student-run philanthropy in the state of Maryland.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,160
We raise funds and awareness for Children's National Health System.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,400
We're here at the Army today where we all pledge to stand for 12 hours to honor the

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,240
patients and families at Children's National Health System.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,240
We spend all year caring for these kids, caring for the hospital, and the most incredible

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,680
thing is to see 3,000 students coming together and supporting the hospital, supporting the

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,920
kids.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,920
It's not a feeling you can describe.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,520
Back in 2010, Brooke was about to turn two.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,360
Brooke was treated at Children's National Medical Center for Acute Myeloid Leukemia, and Caitlin

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,720
actually was her donor, gave her bone marrow to cure her cancer, and so they asked us to

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,800
get involved in fundraising, and they invited us to Turpan.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,480
The girls come here, they get treated like rock stars.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,480
To Turpan, I actually host events all year round to raise money for the kids at the hospital,

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,680
and that's everything from hosting a festival of hope color on earlier this year, blood

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,760
drives, the whole line yards.

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,880
I am so proud and so inspired by Turpan.

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,600
One of Turpan's biggest missions has always been to create this culture of philanthropy

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
on campus.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,520
And now that the University of Maryland is the Do Good University, we are so excited

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,520
to be surrounded by people on campus whose priority is philanthropy.
