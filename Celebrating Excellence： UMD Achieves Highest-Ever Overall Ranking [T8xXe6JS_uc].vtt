Hello Terps, the University of Maryland has earned our reputation as one of the premier

00:10.560 --> 00:12.680
universities in the world.

00:12.680 --> 00:17.840
We are approaching 70 members of the prestigious national academies among our faculty and have

00:17.840 --> 00:22.920
nearly 50 members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

00:22.920 --> 00:29.160
Our students earned more than 100 major national and international awards last year, including

00:29.160 --> 00:34.720
54 students and scholars who accepted Fulbright grants.

00:34.720 --> 00:39.680
This week, U.S. News and World Report released its annual college rankings and the University

00:39.680 --> 00:43.680
of Maryland ranked 19th among all U.S. public universities.

00:43.680 --> 00:50.440
Additionally, we now have almost 70 schools, colleges, programs and specialties on the

00:50.440 --> 00:54.640
U.S. News Top 25 lists.

00:54.640 --> 00:59.480
Our excellence extends well beyond our nationally recognized academic programs.

00:59.480 --> 01:03.680
Number 1 School for LGBTQ Plus Students

01:03.680 --> 01:08.480
A top school for entrepreneurship, for veterans and for research.

01:08.480 --> 01:14.000
And we were also recognized as one of the best places to work by both Newsweek Magazine

01:14.000 --> 01:16.040
and Forbes Magazine.

01:16.040 --> 01:22.200
Collectively, these rankings fill me with tremendous pride and I hope they make you proud of your

01:22.200 --> 01:24.240
flagship university.

01:24.240 --> 01:30.400
These rankings are important, but more importantly are what they represent.

01:30.400 --> 01:35.880
Rankings are not merely numbers, they are a reflection of our commitments and our priorities,

01:35.880 --> 01:41.600
including our focus on building academic and research excellence, fostering a welcoming

01:41.600 --> 01:47.720
multicultural community, creating an innovative and entrepreneurial culture and investing

01:47.720 --> 01:51.000
in people and communities.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.840
It is extremely gratifying to see these investments and priorities being reflected in national

01:56.840 --> 01:59.000
and international rankings.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.280
When we pursue excellence in all we do, the University of Maryland continues our upward

02:04.280 --> 02:05.760
trajectory.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.280
And that's something we can all be proud of.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.360
Go Terps!
