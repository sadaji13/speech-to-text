0	9720	Today we are so excited to welcome thousands of University of Maryland students as we all
9720	12600	come together united under one cause.
12600	16080	Turpan is the largest student-run philanthropy in the state of Maryland.
16080	21160	We raise funds and awareness for Children's National Health System.
21160	25400	We're here at the Army today where we all pledge to stand for 12 hours to honor the
25400	28240	patients and families at Children's National Health System.
28240	32240	We spend all year caring for these kids, caring for the hospital, and the most incredible
32240	36680	thing is to see 3,000 students coming together and supporting the hospital, supporting the
36680	37920	kids.
37920	42920	It's not a feeling you can describe.
42920	46520	Back in 2010, Brooke was about to turn two.
46520	51360	Brooke was treated at Children's National Medical Center for Acute Myeloid Leukemia, and Caitlin
51360	55720	actually was her donor, gave her bone marrow to cure her cancer, and so they asked us to
55720	58800	get involved in fundraising, and they invited us to Turpan.
58800	62480	The girls come here, they get treated like rock stars.
62480	66480	To Turpan, I actually host events all year round to raise money for the kids at the hospital,
66480	70680	and that's everything from hosting a festival of hope color on earlier this year, blood
70680	72760	drives, the whole line yards.
72760	77880	I am so proud and so inspired by Turpan.
77880	81600	One of Turpan's biggest missions has always been to create this culture of philanthropy
81600	82600	on campus.
82800	87520	And now that the University of Maryland is the Do Good University, we are so excited
87520	90520	to be surrounded by people on campus whose priority is philanthropy.
